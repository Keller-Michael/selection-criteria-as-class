# handle selection criteria as class
## description
This development shows how to deal with selection criteria dynamically. The transfer of all selection criteria to the constructor of the application class should be simplified. For that an instance of the local helper class pushs parameters and select options dynamically to an instance of a global class. Afterwards the instance of the global class is given to the constructor of the application class.
