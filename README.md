# handle selection criteria as class
## description
This development shows how to deal with selection criteria dynamically. The transfer of all selection criteria of a report to the constructor of the application class should be simplified. For that an instance of the local helper class pushes parameters and select options of the report dynamically to an instance of a global class. Afterwards the instance of the global class is given to the constructor of the application class.
